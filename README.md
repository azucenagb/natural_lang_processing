# INFR08008 - Processing Formal and Natural Languages

This course was about processing natural and artificial languages. This course considered how the same models of language can be used to describe and analyse both formal languages (such as programming languages) and natural languages (text and speech). It included material on formal languages and grammars, probabilistic grammars (including hidden Markov models), semantic analysis and human language processing.

## Assessment 1

The objective of this practical was to illustrate the language processing pipeline in the case of a small but interesting fragment of the Haskell programming language, Micro-Haskell (or MH).

## Assessment 2

In this assignment, we used Pythonand NLTK to construct a system that reads simple facts and then answers questions about them.
