	An inconvenience that I encountered while testing my system was that I had to introduce the statements "John is a duck" and "Mary is a duck" separately instead of being able to directly say "John and Mary are ducks". Therefore an improvement would be to program the system to accept such double statements. 
	To do so we would have to create a new rule NP -> NP AND NP. This would lead to left recursion which would make the grammar non-LL(1) but since the rule VP -> VP AND VP already exists, the grammer is already non-LL(1) so we do not have to worry about this new left recursive rule. This new rule would not be too complicated to implement.
	For the majority of verbs, the plural tense is the same as the singular so we would not have to worry about adding a new verb tense to discern between plural and singular subject statements. However, we would need to make improvements on agreement checking. (For example, we could not have "John and people are ducks" since John is singular and people is plural).
	Also, the system would have to know how to divide the statements and add them into the Lexicon and Factbase separately. This could complicate the system, but once we've managed to compute the parse trees correctly it shouldn't be a problem.
